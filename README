Games/GoogleWhack version 1.4
=============================

GoogleWhack is a game. The idea of the game is to generate a page on google
that reports only one result by entering a query with two words (quotes may
not surround the words). There are three rules:

- Must generate one, and only one result on google, ie Results 1 - 1 of 1
- The resulting page must not be a list of words
- Both words must be listed in dictionary.com
